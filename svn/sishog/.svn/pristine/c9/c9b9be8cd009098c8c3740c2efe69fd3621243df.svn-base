\begin{abstract}
Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is a popular feature description for the purpose of object detection.
However, HOG algorithm requires a performance system because of its complex
operation set.
Especially, the cell histogram generation in HOG (feature extraction) is one
of the most complex part, it uses inverse tangent, square, square root, floating
point multiplication.
In this paper, we propose a novel methodology of cell histogram
generation, which determines quantized orientation exactly and computes corresponding
gradient magnitude robustly and flexibly  without any calculation of the gradient of pixel.
The proposed method has a form of only 30 addition and 40 shift operations per pixel.
Simulation results show that the percentage error when reconstructing the
difference in \textit{x} and \textit{y} direction are  always less than 2\% with 8-bit length of the fractional part.
Additionally, manipulating the precision of gradient manipulate 
is via pre-defined \textit{sine} and \textit{cosine}  values of quantized angles.
Synthesizing the hardware implementation presents that its area cost is 3.57 KGates with
45nm NanGate standard cell library.
The hardware module runs at the maximum frequency of 400 MHz, and the throughput is
0.4 (pixel/ns) for a single module.
It is able to support about 48 fps with 4K UHD resolution.
