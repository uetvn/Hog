\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a new methodology to do cell histogram generation
part with only set of  addition and shift operation.
With this methodology,  extracting HOG feature of pixel  requires about 30
additions and 40 shifts.
Another important characteristic of this methodology is that it is robust.
The error of the reconstructed values of $d_x$ and $d_y$ from the two voted bins are always
less than 2\%.
Additionally, it is very flexible, we only need to define new constants
for  \textit{sine}  and \textit{cosine} values of quantized angles for changing the precision.
Implementing the proposed methodology into hardware takes about 3.57 KGates
with 45nm NanGate standard cell library
The hardware module runs at maximum frequency 400 MHz, and the throughput reaches
0.4 (pixel/ns) for a single module.
