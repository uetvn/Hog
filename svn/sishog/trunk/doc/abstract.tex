\begin{abstract}
Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is a popular feature description for the purpose of object detection.
However, HOG algorithm requires performance system because of the complex operations set: $\arctan$,
square root, float multiply.
Especially, the cell histogram extraction in HOG (feature extraction) is one 
the most complex part.
In this paper, we propose a methodology to improve the cell histogram extraction
part by using only shift and addition operations.
For each pixel, it spends about 30 addition and 40 shift operations.
Simulation results shows that the percentage error of calculations are always less than
2\% with 8-bits length in fraction part.
Implementing the propose methodology into hardware presents \fixme{hw result.}
