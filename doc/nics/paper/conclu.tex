\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed a new methodology to do cell histogram generation
part without calculating the actual gradient of pixel.
It identifies the two bins by the properties of decomposing gradient of pixel
into two standard vectors.
This methodology  extracts HOG feature of pixel with 30
additions and 40 shifts.
The error of the reconstructed values of $d_x$ and $d_y$ from the two voted bins are always
less than 2\%.
Additionally, it is very flexible, we only need to define new constants
for  \textit{sine}  and \textit{cosine} values of quantized angles for changing the precision.
Implementing the proposed methodology into hardware takes about 3.57\textit{KGates}
with 45\textit{nm} NanGate standard cell library
The hardware module runs at maximum frequency 400 MHz, and the throughput reaches
0.4 (\textit{pixel/ns}) for a single module.
