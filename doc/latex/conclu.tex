\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed the methodology to do cell histogram generation
part with only set of  addition and shift operation.
With this methodology, we spend about 30 additions and 40 shifts on computing
the two voted bin of a pixels.
Another important characteristic of this methodology is that it provides very
low percentage errors, it is always less than 2\%.
And to change the percentage errors, we only need to change the size of fraction
part via multiplying $\cos$ $\sin$ function with another number.
Implementing the proposed methodology into hardware takes about 3.5 KGates  of
area costs with 45nm NanGate standard cell library
The hardware module runs at maximum frequency 400 MHz, and the throughput is
about 0.4 (pixel/ns) for a single module.
It is able to support about 48 frames/s with 4K UHD resolution.


Our future work includes implementing full HOG algorithm into hardware with our
optimization in cell histogram generation  and
the other optimizations in the normalization and SVM phases.
