\begin{abstract}
Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) is a popular feature description for the purpose of object detection.
However, HOG algorithm requires performance system because of the complex
operations set.
Especially, the cell histogram generation in HOG (feature extraction) is one
the most complex part, it requires one inverse tangent, square root, float
	multiply.
In this paper, we propose a methodology to improve the cell histogram generation
part by using only shift and addition operations.
For each pixel, it spends about 30 addition and 40 shift operations.
Simulation results show that the percentage errors of calculations are always less than
2\% with 8-bits length of the fractional part.
Synthesize the hardware implementation presents that the area cost is 3.5 Kgates with
45nm NanGate standard cell library.
The hardware module runs at maximum frequency 400 MHz, and the throughput is
about 0.4 (pixel/ns) for a single module.
It is able to support about 48 frames/s with 4K UHD resolution.
